**Project Name: Comprehensive Data Analysis Project**

**Description:**
This project encompasses various aspects of data analysis, including COVID-19 data visualization, SQL data cleaning and transformation, Excel data manipulation, and movie correlation analysis. Below is a detailed overview of each component:

**1. COVID-19 Dashboard:**
- This dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data across the globe.
- Utilizes data visualization techniques to present insights into infection rates, mortality rates, recovery rates, and other relevant metrics.
- Enables users to interact with the data, allowing for customized views and exploration.

**2. SQL Queries for Data Cleaning and Transformation:**
- Contains SQL queries that clean and transform raw data related to COVID-19.
